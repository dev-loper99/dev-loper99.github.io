# Dev E. Loper #99

Well, my name is not really Dev E. Loper. The name is a portmanteau of the word *developer*. Hope you already knew that. But please call me **Dev**: ديو, देव, 开发, etc.

## Why #99?
Because of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song.

In order to freely share my thoughts on social media, I have to hide behind the mask of anonymity. Under the *pen-name* of **Dev E. Loper**, I can taste freedom of expression. My thoughts are my own. I do not represent an organization or a group.

## Ex-Muslim?
I was brought up in a conservative Muslim household, but I no longer believe. Unfortunately, excommunication in **Islam** means death or family bycott. Hence: the *pen-name*. Fundamentalist Islam is a dangerous cult and must evolve or face extinction. Practice of Islam is particularly harmful to society. However, I generally stand for free expression and secular governments. Democratic, egalitarian application of security, freedom and welfare makes a good society. My family and friends and all Muslims who still believe, I have nothing against them. It is the **Shari'a** ideology that scares me.

## Software?
Other than religious fundamentalism and its effect on society, sometimes I talk about software and information technology. I was blessed with a good education, so I am already fond of learning and always willing to change my mind. I am very easy to convince and my opinions evolve as I learn new things.

## A/S/L?
25/M/USA. He/him/we/us. I live in America but I travel a lot. I like playing video games, listening to music and discovering the universe — especially astronomy and theoretical physics.
